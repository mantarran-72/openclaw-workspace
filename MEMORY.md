# MEMORY.md — Long-term memory (curated)

## People

* Ethan — precision viticulture \& GIS analyst; drone imagery processing for Northern California vineyards (thermal + multispectral).

## Preferences / Boundaries

* Never delete/overwrite files or folders without explicit approval; do a dry run first.
* For live website edits, Ethan expects proof-first execution on the exact target URL (small verified changes first, then expand).
* Ethan strongly prefers the most practical, complete, likely-to-be-used solution first; avoid toy baselines unless explicitly requested.
* Minimize unnecessary follow-up questions; only ask when the answer materially changes execution or safety requires it.

## Workflow

* OpenClaw workspace is synced via git repo `git@github.com:etarran-aerospect/openclaw-workspace.git`.
* Habit: `git pull --rebase` before starting work; commit + push after sessions so both machines stay in sync.

## Setup notes

* Primary chat surface: Telegram DM.
* Desktop: agent identity `Claw-Desktop`.
* Laptop: separate OpenClaw instance named `Claw-Laptop`.
* Conway integration for this setup uses `mcporter` + `conway-terminal` (not `mcpServers` in `openclaw.json` on current tested builds).
* ChatGPT second seat account email: `joe.brown@aerospectinc.com`.
* Shared Drive workflow folder for cross-model handoffs: `AI-Handoffs` (`12i5sOnnKRZQO3SahByrIG4DZvmMTEnZH`) with INBOX/SPEC/DONE/HOW-TO docs.

## Active project notes

* AeroSpect website migration prep completed on 2026-02-26 with a packaged handoff for Lovable in `reports/website-handoff-2026-02-26/` (prompts, NDVI overlay TypeScript data, and asset checklist).
* On 2026-02-27, finalization assets were added in the same folder (`website-finalization-runbook`, `lovable-compact-input`, and 10-minute manual QA checklist) and homepage messaging was tightened around decision-ready vineyard intelligence.
* Pitch deck work added on 2026-02-27: Market Opportunity slide drafts (exec + investor versions) in `reports/` and uploaded to Drive folder `Pitch Deck Slide Drafts 2026-02-27`.
* On 2026-03-24, Ethan confirmed the correct local AeroSpect homepage baseline for preview/edit work is `/home/ethan/.openclaw/workspace/aerospect-homepage-preview-live-baseline/` (not `aerospect/` and not `aerospect-deployed-site/aerospect`). This is the one with the live-style homepage `How It Works` section, the text “From flight to recommendation, we turn aerial data into practical vineyard decisions.”, and image `/images/drone-inspection.jpg` targeted for the 3-image replacement preview.
* On 2026-04-24, Ethan explored a startup thesis around autonomous vineyard monitoring infrastructure: the key insight is that a viable ag dock product must solve thermal + multispectral sensor mismatch, autonomous CRP/calibration capture, automated processing/data offload, and ROI on expensive docked hardware. Current best framing is workflow/software-first with premium integrated pilots rather than starting with a fully proprietary dock.
