# MEMORY.md — Long-term memory (curated)

## People
- Ethan — precision viticulture & GIS analyst; drone imagery processing for Northern California vineyards (thermal + multispectral).
- Ethan also has a strong construction and security background: former commercial general contractor; former government contractor for security installations on military bases; 3,000+ licensed drone flight hours across construction, energy, agriculture, and infrastructure environments. For data center / mission-critical positioning, this background should be treated as a core credibility signal, not a side note.

## Preferences / Boundaries
- Never delete/overwrite files or folders without explicit approval; do a dry run first.
- For live website edits, Ethan expects proof-first execution on the exact target URL (small verified changes first, then expand).
- Ethan strongly prefers the most practical, complete, likely-to-be-used solution first; avoid toy baselines unless explicitly requested.
- Minimize unnecessary follow-up questions; only ask when the answer materially changes execution or safety requires it.

## Workflow
- OpenClaw workspace is synced via git repo `git@github.com:etarran-aerospect/openclaw-workspace.git`.
- Habit: `git pull --rebase` before starting work; commit + push after sessions so both machines stay in sync.
- 2026-05-21 reinstall recovery: local workspace was reconnected to `https://github.com/etarran-aerospect/openclaw-workspace.git` after Ethan provided the repo URL. `origin/main` contained the missing long-term and daily memory files, which were restored selectively.

## Setup notes
- Primary chat surface: Telegram DM.
- Desktop: agent identity `Claw-Desktop`.
- Laptop: separate OpenClaw instance named `Claw-Laptop`.
- Conway integration for this setup uses `mcporter` + `conway-terminal` (not `mcpServers` in `openclaw.json` on current tested builds).
- ChatGPT second seat account email: `joe.brown@aerospectinc.com`.
- Shared Drive workflow folder for cross-model handoffs: `AI-Handoffs` (`12i5sOnnKRZQO3SahByrIG4DZvmMTEnZH`) with INBOX/SPEC/DONE/HOW-TO docs.

## Active project notes
- AeroSpect infrastructure/data-center positioning: frame as aerial reality capture, construction progress documentation, photogrammetry, GIS site intelligence, thermal imaging, and perimeter/security documentation for mission-critical construction and data-center-adjacent contractors. Avoid generic "drone services" language.
- For mission-critical/data-center positioning, Ethan's non-geographic BVLOS waiver should be presented as a deployment-speed advantage for drone dock systems: less waiting on a new site-specific waiver process, useful when construction/security work sits idle for long periods and then suddenly needs recurring monitoring to start immediately.
- AeroSpect website migration prep completed on 2026-02-26 with a packaged handoff for Lovable in `reports/website-handoff-2026-02-26/` (prompts, NDVI overlay TypeScript data, and asset checklist).
- On 2026-02-27, finalization assets were added in the same folder (`website-finalization-runbook`, `lovable-compact-input`, and 10-minute manual QA checklist) and homepage messaging was tightened around decision-ready vineyard intelligence.
- Pitch deck work added on 2026-02-27: Market Opportunity slide drafts (exec + investor versions) in `reports/` and uploaded to Drive folder `Pitch Deck Slide Drafts 2026-02-27`.
- On 2026-03-24, Ethan confirmed the correct local AeroSpect homepage baseline for preview/edit work is `/home/ethan/.openclaw/workspace/aerospect-homepage-preview-live-baseline/` (not `aerospect/` and not `aerospect-deployed-site/aerospect`). This is the one with the live-style homepage `How It Works` section, the text “From flight to recommendation, we turn aerial data into practical vineyard decisions.”, and image `/images/drone-inspection.jpg` targeted for the 3-image replacement preview.

## Restore Notes
- Do not import backup credentials, device auth, Telegram pairing, bot token config, gateway token config, or old Windows-specific paths unless Ethan explicitly asks and current runtime needs them.
- The local file backup at `~/projects/openclaw-backup` did not include prior memory files; the GitHub repo was the source of recovered memory.
